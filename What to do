Not for Coding in!

This is created for FRC Team 6865, Manitoulin Metal. This is to make sure everyone knows what their role is and what we should do next.

Next Steps:
1. Create Vision Base
2. Start Workflow
3. Researching Vision and AdvantageKit, along with playing around with WPILib's new toys
4. Start April Tag recognition running for limelights
5. Figure out how to change the limelight's IP (Since it conflicts with the RoboRIO2's IP)

Roles:
Xander: Start Vision, Start creating Autos, Start AprilTag recognition for new robot
Nate: Catch up and learn about code again
Fredrick: Unknown
Mandy: Unknown

Things that have not been set as a responsibility for someone:
1. Shooter Commands (Xander might take this responsibility)
2. Intake Commands (Nate might take this, since it should be easier than the Shooter Command)
3. Auto Align??? (If we do this, Xander should do it)
4. Make the most of AdvantageKit (Xander/Nate/Argall)
5. Figure out how to change the limelight's IP (Since it conflicts with the RoboRIO2's IP)
